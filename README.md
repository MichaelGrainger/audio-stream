## Issue
Our application chains multiple audio buffers together for playback. While the buffers do play in sequence, there is a brief "pop" or "click" between them. I am looking for a solution that ensures seamless transitions between each buffer, potentially using crossfading or another effective method to eliminate any audible gaps or artifacts.
